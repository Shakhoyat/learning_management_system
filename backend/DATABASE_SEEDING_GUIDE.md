## 🚀 **How to Seed Your Database**

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
# Ensure Docker containers are running
docker-compose up -d

# Clear existing data (optional)
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh
```

### **Run Complete Seeding**
```bash
# Seed everything at once
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed

# Or seed individual components
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed --class=CategorySeeder
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed --class=CourseSeeder
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed --class=EnrollmentSeeder
```

### **Verify Seeding Results**
```bash
# Check data counts
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker --execute="
echo 'Users: ' . App\Models\User::count();
echo 'Courses: ' . App\Models\Course::count();
echo 'Lessons: ' . App\Models\Lesson::count();
echo 'Enrollments: ' . App\Models\Enrollment::count();

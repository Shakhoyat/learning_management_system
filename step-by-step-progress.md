I'll help you create a comprehensive, recruiter-focused LMS project that showcases modern web development skills. Let me break this down into a detailed daily workflow that emphasizes clean commits, professional development practices, and impressive features that demonstrate real-world capabilities.

## **Advanced LMS Project: 8-Day Development Sprint**

### **Project Overview & Tech Stack**

Your LMS will demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development with these technologies:
- **Backend**: Laravel 11 with Sanctum authentication, Redis caching, and queue jobs
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing and relationships
- **Additional**: Docker for containerization, GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Let me guide you through each day with specific tasks and commit strategies that will make your GitHub activity graph look professional and consistent.

### **Day 1: Foundation & Database Architecture**

**Morning Session (4 hours):**
Start by setting up your development environment with Docker. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file that spins up PostgreSQL, Redis, and your Laravel application. This immediately shows recruiters you understand containerization.

```yaml
# Commit 1: "feat: Initialize Docker environment with PostgreSQL and Redis"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
  app:
    build: ./backend
```

Design your database schema thoughtfully. Create migrations for these core tables:
- `users` (with roles: admin, instructor, student)
- `courses` (title, description, thumbnail, price, instructor_id)
- `modules` (course_id, title, order_index)
- `lessons` (module_id, title, content, video_url, duration, order_index)
- `enrollments` (user_id, course_id, enrolled_at, completed_at)
- `progress` (user_id, lesson_id, completed_at, time_spent)

**Afternoon Session (4 hours):**
Implement Laravel authentication with Sanctum, but go beyond basics. Add email verification, password reset functionality, and role-based middleware. Create separate API route groups for each user role.

```php
// Commit 2: "feat: Implement multi-role authentication with Sanctum"
// Commit 3: "feat: Add role-based middleware and API route protection"
```

### **Day 2: Core Backend APIs & Advanced Features**

**Morning Session:**
Build your course management APIs with proper resource controllers. Implement pagination, filtering, and searching capabilities using Laravel's query builder. Add Eloquent relationships with eager loading to prevent N+1 queries.

```php
// Example: CoursesController with advanced filtering
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $courses = Course::with(['instructor', 'modules.lessons'])
        ->when($request->search, function($query, $search) {
            $query->where('title', 'like', "%{$search}%");
        })
        ->when($request->category, function($query, $category) {
            $query->where('category_id', $category);
        })
        ->paginate(12);
}
```

**Afternoon Session:**
Implement a sophisticated enrollment system with payment simulation. Add a `transactions` table to track payments, and use database transactions to ensure data consistency. Create a queue job for sending enrollment confirmation emails.

```php
// Commit 4: "feat: Add course CRUD with advanced filtering and search"
// Commit 5: "feat: Implement enrollment system with payment tracking"
// Commit 6: "feat: Add queue jobs for email notifications"
```

### **Day 3: Progress Tracking & Analytics**

**Morning Session:**
Build a comprehensive progress tracking system. Create endpoints that calculate completion percentages at lesson, module, and course levels. Use PostgreSQL window functions for efficient analytics queries.

```sql
-- Example: Calculate student progress across all enrolled courses
WITH lesson_progress AS (
    SELECT user_id, course_id, 
           COUNT(DISTINCT p.lesson_id) as completed_lessons,
           COUNT(DISTINCT l.id) as total_lessons
    FROM enrollments e
    JOIN lessons l ON l.course_id = e.course_id
    LEFT JOIN progress p ON p.user_id = e.user_id AND p.lesson_id = l.id
    GROUP BY user_id, course_id
)
SELECT *, (completed_lessons::float / total_lessons * 100) as completion_percentage
FROM lesson_progress;
```

**Afternoon Session:**
Add a quiz system with multiple question types (MCQ, true/false, short answer). Implement automatic grading for objective questions and store results in a `quiz_attempts` table. Create analytics endpoints for instructors to view student performance.

```php
// Commit 7: "feat: Add comprehensive progress tracking system"
// Commit 8: "feat: Implement quiz module with auto-grading"
// Commit 9: "feat: Add instructor analytics dashboard API"
```

### **Day 4: Next.js Frontend Foundation**

**Morning Session:**
Initialize your Next.js application with TypeScript and configure it properly. Set up your authentication context using Next-Auth or a custom solution with Sanctum. Create a clean folder structure that separates concerns:

```
/app
  /(auth)
    /login
    /register
  /(dashboard)
    /student
    /instructor
    /admin
/components
  /ui (shadcn components)
  /features
/lib
  /api (API client functions)
  /hooks (custom React hooks)
```

**Afternoon Session:**
Build reusable components using shadcn/ui for a professional look. Create a responsive navigation system that adapts based on user roles. Implement proper loading states and error boundaries.

```typescript
// Commit 10: "feat: Initialize Next.js with TypeScript and authentication"
// Commit 11: "feat: Add role-based navigation and layout components"
// Commit 12: "feat: Implement reusable UI components with shadcn"
```

### **Day 5: Student Experience**

**Morning Session:**
Create the student dashboard with course browsing, filtering, and search functionality. Implement infinite scrolling or pagination for course listings. Add course detail pages with module/lesson structure visualization.

**Afternoon Session:**
Build the lesson player interface with video support, markdown content rendering, and progress tracking. Implement keyboard shortcuts for navigation and create a distraction-free learning mode. Add note-taking functionality that saves to the backend.

```typescript
// Example: Custom hook for lesson navigation
const useLessonNavigation = () => {
  const { lessonId } = useParams();
  const router = useRouter();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleKeyPress = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') navigateToNext();
      if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') navigateToPrevious();
    };
    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
  }, [lessonId]);
};
```

```typescript
// Commit 13: "feat: Build student dashboard with course discovery"
// Commit 14: "feat: Add lesson player with keyboard navigation"
// Commit 15: "feat: Implement note-taking system for students"
```

### **Day 6: Instructor Features & Content Management**

**Morning Session:**
Create the instructor dashboard showing course analytics, student enrollments, and revenue metrics. Use Recharts or Chart.js to create beautiful visualizations of student progress and engagement metrics.

**Afternoon Session:**
Build a course creation wizard with step-by-step forms. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering lessons and modules. Add a rich text editor for lesson content creation with image upload support using Laravel's storage system.

```typescript
// Commit 16: "feat: Add instructor dashboard with analytics"
// Commit 17: "feat: Implement course builder with drag-and-drop"
// Commit 18: "feat: Add rich content editor with media uploads"
```

### **Day 7: Performance & Advanced Features**

**Morning Session:**
Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data like course listings and user progress. Add database indexing on foreign keys and commonly queried columns. Implement API response caching with proper cache invalidation strategies.

```php
// Example: Caching course data
public function show($id)
{
    return Cache::remember("course.{$id}", 3600, function() use ($id) {
        return Course::with(['modules.lessons', 'instructor'])->findOrFail($id);
    });
}
```

**Afternoon Session:**
Add real-time features using Laravel Echo and WebSockets (or Pusher for simplicity). Implement live notifications for new course announcements and quiz results. Create a discussion forum for each course with real-time updates.

```javascript
// Commit 19: "feat: Add Redis caching layer for performance"
// Commit 20: "feat: Implement real-time notifications system"
// Commit 21: "feat: Add course discussion forums with live updates"
```

### **Day 8: Polish & Deployment Preparation**

**Morning Session:**
Add comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error pages. Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse. Create a sitemap for SEO and add Open Graph meta tags for social sharing.

**Afternoon Session:**
Write comprehensive tests for critical functionality (authentication, enrollment, progress tracking). Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration with automated testing. Create detailed API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman collections.

Create an impressive README with:
- Architecture diagram
- Database schema visualization
- API documentation link
- Demo credentials
- Performance metrics (response times, database query optimization)
- Screenshots/GIFs of key features

```yaml
# GitHub Actions CI/CD
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          docker-compose up -d
          docker-compose exec app php artisan test
```

```markdown
# Commit 22: "feat: Add comprehensive error handling and rate limiting"
# Commit 23: "test: Add test coverage for critical features"
# Commit 24: "docs: Add comprehensive README and API documentation"
# Commit 25: "ci: Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing"
```

<!-- ### **Bonus Features for Extra Impact (Optional Day 9-10):**

If you have extra time, consider adding these high-value features:

1. **AI-Powered Features**: Integrate OpenAI API for automatic quiz generation from lesson content or personalized learning recommendations based on progress patterns.

2. **Certificate Generation**: Create a PDF certificate generation system using libraries like DomPDF or Puppeteer when students complete courses.

3. **Multi-language Support**: Implement i18n in both backend and frontend to demonstrate internationalization capabilities.

4. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Create detailed learning analytics with heat maps showing when students are most active, dropout points in courses, and predictive completion rates.

### **Key Points for Recruiter Appeal:**

Your commit history should tell a story of professional development. Make commits atomic and meaningful - each commit should represent a complete feature or fix. Write clear commit messages following conventional commits specification (feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, refactor:).

Throughout development, demonstrate these practices:
- Write clean, commented code explaining complex logic
- Use design patterns appropriately (Repository pattern, Service classes)
- Implement proper validation and sanitization
- Show security awareness (CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection)
- Document your API endpoints thoroughly
- Include performance considerations in your README

Remember to deploy your application to a service like Railway or Vercel/Supabase combo, providing recruiters with a live demo link. Create demo accounts with pre-populated data so recruiters can immediately explore all features without having to create content themselves.

This project structure demonstrates full-stack proficiency, modern development practices, and the ability to build complex, real-world applications - exactly what recruiters want to see in a portfolio project. -->

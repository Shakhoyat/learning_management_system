## 🐳 Docker Configuration

### Services Running
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript (Port 3001)
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 API (Port 8000)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (Port 5433)
- **Cache**: Redis Alpine (Port 6380)

### Why Different Ports?
- Host system already had PostgreSQL (5432), Redis (6379), and Next.js (3000) running
- Docker containers use alternative ports to avoid conflicts
- Internal container networking uses standard ports
